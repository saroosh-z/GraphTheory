# GraphTheory
My independent study on graph theory and graph database

1. Floyd Warshall's Algorithm: to find the minimum distance between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph with positive or negative edges.

2. Kruskal's Algorithm: Used to find a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. it's a greedy algorithm.
